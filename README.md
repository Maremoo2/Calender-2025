Customizable Calendar with Categories and Comments
This is a web-based calendar for 2025, allowing users to customize each day's events with up to 10 different categories. Users can select custom colors and names for these categories and add comments to each day. The calendar also features a Reset Date function to selectively remove categories from a specific day.

Features
1. Month Navigation

Each assigned category will color a portion of the day, dividing the day box into sections according to how many categories are applied.
